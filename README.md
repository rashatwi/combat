# ComBat Database 

<img src=logo.png>

## Overview 
The Computational Database for Li-S Batteries (ComBat) is a publicly 
available dataset of quantum-chemical and molecular dynamics properties 
for Li-S electrolytes containing solvents spanning 16 different chemical 
classes. 

The data includes DFT-optimized geometries (in PDB format) and several 
properties, such as binding energies, partial atomic charges, 
polarizabilities, dipole moments, as well as MD-derived properties, such
as radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, diffusion coefficients,
and more. More details about each property can be found in the ReadME file 
associated with each dataset. 

## Updates 
For a description of the updates corresponding to each version,
